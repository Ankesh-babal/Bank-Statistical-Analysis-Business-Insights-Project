# Bank-Statistical-Analysis-Business-Insights-Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
Bank is striving to become more data-driven in its decision-making and customer strategy. This project focuses on statistical analysis and business insights generation using Python to evaluate customer behavior, transaction patterns, and financial metrics. The goal is to derive actionable insights from the data using statistical techniques, EDA, and hypothesis testing to support strategic decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python. <br>
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.<br>
SciPy, Statsmodels.<br>
Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Data Visualization.<br>
Statistical Inference.<br>

## 📈 Key Highlights of the Project
#### Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored customer attributes, transaction patterns, distributions, and segment-wise behavior using visual tools (bar plots, boxplots, histograms).
#### Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
Applied statistical techniques like z-tests, t-tests, confidence intervals, ANOVA, chi-square tests to validate hypotheses and interpret business scenarios.
#### Data-Driven Business Questions
Answered real-world business questions like:
- Is there a significant difference in spending across customer segments?<br>
- Do male and female customers behave differently in terms of transactions?<br>
- Are certain customer groups more profitable or risk-prone?<br>
- Is there a correlation between customer attributes and financial behaviors?<br>

## 🧠 Analytical Techniques Used
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. <br>
Outlier Detection & Treatment.<br>
Normality Check (Shapiro-Wilk, QQ plots).<br>
T-tests (one sample, two-sample, paired).<br>
Chi-square Test for Independence.<br>
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).<br>
Z-test for proportions.<br>
Confidence Interval Estimation.<br>
Skewness and Kurtosis checks.<br>
Correlation Heatmaps.<br>

## 📊 Visualizations Created
Distribution plots of transaction values.<br>
Gender-wise comparison of banking behaviors.<br>
Boxplots for segment-wise income and balance.<br>
Bar charts showing categorical frequency and cross-tabulations.<br>
Correlation heatmaps for numeric variable dependencies.<br>

## 📁 Dataset Details
Simulated banking data covering:<br>
- Customer ID, Age, Gender.<br>
- Region, Occupation, Income.<br>
- Current Account Balance, Number of Products.<br>
- Transaction Type and Amount. <br>
- Segment Classification (Retail, Corporate, etc.) <br>

## Business Insights Generated
Identified high-value customer segments.<br>
Gender and age groups with higher transaction frequency.<br>
Regions with stronger revenue contribution.<br>
Statistically validated differences in behaviors across key demographic groups.<br>
Business hypotheses tested with statistical rigor.<br>
